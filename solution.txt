Commit in git is when you add new changes to a file and the reason for the changes.
A branch in git is like a different version of the main branch.
A pull request is when you're making changes from one branch to the other in repos.
We initialize a new git repository using the command line "git init", then Enter.
To clone repository from github, you can use git bash or your terminal by using the command line "git clone + the URL of the repository you want to clone", then Enter.
You can stage change for a commit by using the the command line "git add + the file you want to stage" or you can use "git add ." to stage all changes.
To push changes to a remote repo, you first need to stage and commit the changes with a commit message. The next thing is to use the command line "git push -u origin main".
